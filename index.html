				Duck Pirates is a game being developed by a team of university students from The University of York as part of a project.<br>
				The aim of this project is to create a pirate game based on our university's campus that has been flouded and is now plagued with pirates.<br>
				<br>
				During the game you will play as one of these pirate vessils with your allegiance tied to one of the 10 colleges of the university.<br>
				Your objective it to destroy the other colleges and steal their plunder whiles overcoming other obsticles such as bad weather, monsters and enemy ships.<br>
				Will you be able to overcome the waves of York to become the one true pirate king?<br>
				<br>
				We will be updating this website with our journy through the design and conceptualisation process.<br>
				Stay tuned for more!<br>
				<br>
				Team 19
